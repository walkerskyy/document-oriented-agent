Booking Performance
The Booking Performance report allows you to evaluate the performance of your property by displaying key performance metrics across your property's bookings. It also shows you where your bookings are coming from. 
The data used in this report is sourced from your Channel Manager.
If you receive reservations in multiple currencies then all reservations are converted to your default currency as at the booked date. 

When reviewing data in the Booking Perfomance report, you can filter reservation data by the following date ranges:

    Booked-on date: reservations created during the selected date range
    Check-in date: reservations checking in during the selected date range
    Stay date: reservations that have at least one night that falls within the selected date range.


Summary
The headline summary allows you to evaluate the overall performance of your property for the selected time period. This summary is not split by Channel or country, so you can see the entire performance at one glance. The metrics displayed are compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, having a green or red indicator next to them, that lets you know how your property is doing in comparison.
Metrics displayed in the headline summary are Room Revenue, Total Revenue, Reservations(after cancellations), Cancelled reservations, Room nights, Average daily rate, Average lead time, and Average length of stay.


Filters
Filters in Booking Performance allow you to evaluate your performance for a subset of data from available filters like All channels, countries, room types & rate plans. This will help you understand your performance for a particular metric when compared to other reports. 
To use filters in Booking Performance:

    Click on the filters button
    Select the filters you would like to apply
